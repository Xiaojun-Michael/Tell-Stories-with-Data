All the references for the final data story is listed in the reference part at the end of data stroy.

### Reflections
**Changes made since Part II**
1. To highlight the comparison of pre and post BLM arest number, I have changed the original line chart for each month over an one year period to a bar chart that consists only two months data. I received the feedback that audience's attention are likely be drawn to other infomation of the line chart, or they cannnot quickly get the comparison before and after BLM, so the bar chart would be able to highlight the comparison more, help audience quickly understand the point.
2. I added two donut charts to complete the logical flow. The donut chart will show the breakdown of arrests by offenses people get arrested for. This is also something menioned in the user research that haveing the donut chart here connecting the general arrest number change and a deep dive into a kind of arrest would complete the overall logical flow of the presentation.
3. For the map, I have fixed the color of arrest by race to remain a consistent color schema during the entire presentation.
4. For the map, I have highlight the neighborhoods with culstered arrests. During class group discussion, I received this feedback that people who are not Pittsburgh local may not know where the mentioned neighborhoods are, if I only list out the neighborhood names,highlight the neighborhoods with a different color helps audience get a more intuitive sense when I am talking about the neighborhoods.
5. To make the call-for-action more actionable and feasible, I have attached a pittsburgh local community organization link to call for following the organization's effort online and see what you could help. This is much more actionable than my previous call-for-action of pay more attention to communities and local effort.
6. I have recognized the limitation to my analysis, the whole story is complete and some interesting insights are found, but my analysis is just a descriptive analysis, but not robust enough to draw any causal effect conclusion. So, for my second call-for-action, instead of calling for stronger changes, I am now calling for donation to racial equality changes. I believe that more robust studies could bring insights that are potentially world-changing, and that's a much more reasonable call-for-action with the current project.
