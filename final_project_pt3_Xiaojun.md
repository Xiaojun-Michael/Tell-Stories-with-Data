All the references for the final data story is listed in the reference part at the end of data stroy.

### Reflections
**Changes made since Part II**
1. To highlight the comparison of pre and post BLM arest number, I have changed the original line chart for each month over an one year period to a bar chart that consists only two months data. I received the feedback that audience's attention are likely be drawn to other infomation of the line chart, or they cannnot quickly get the comparison before and after BLM, so the bar chart would be able to highlight the comparison more, help audience quickly understand the point.
2. I added two donut charts to complete the logical flow. The donut chart will show the breakdown of arrests by offenses people get arrested for. This is also something menioned in the user research that haveing the donut chart here connecting the general arrest number change and a deep dive into a kind of arrest would complete the overall logical flow of the presentation.
3. For the map, I have fixed the color of arrest by race to remain a consistent color schema during the entire presentation.
4. For the map, I have highlight the neighborhoods with culstered arrests. During class group discussion, I received this feedback that people who are not Pittsburgh local may not know where the mentioned neighborhoods are, if I only list out the neighborhood names,highlight the neighborhoods with a different color helps audience get a more intuitive sense when I am talking about the neighborhoods.
5. To make the call-for-action more actionable and feasible, I have attached a pittsburgh local community organization link to call for following the organization's effort online and see what you could help. This is much more actionable than my previous call-for-action of pay more attention to communities and local effort.
6. I have recognized the limitation to my analysis, the whole story is complete and some interesting insights are found, but my analysis is just a descriptive analysis, but not robust enough to draw any causal effect conclusion. So, for my second call-for-action, instead of calling for stronger changes, I am now calling for donation to racial equality changes. I believe that more robust studies could bring insights that are potentially world-changing, and that's a much more reasonable call-for-action with the current project.

**Identified audience for final data story**
The general audience I have identified for the data story are people who are interested in racial equality movements. Perticularly, because my analysis is based on Pittsburgh data, people who are living in the Pittsburgh area would be more interested.

I think Pittsburgh students with an interest in social problems would be the early adopter of my presentation, they would be very interested in this story and be able to provide great feedback to my data story before the story spreads to a wider group of users. Lucky for me, the final presentation for the class is a great opportunity for me to present to the early adopters of the story. Many students at Heinz college care about racial equality movements and they are currently living in Pittsburgh area. I would say that my classmates are a representative group of my intented early audience. During the group discussions in class, I have confirmed my hypothesis that many students at Heinz is interested in the topic. So I think my audience identification and early adopter identification for the story is relatively accurate.

**Work, design decisions and observations**
There are many decision choices to be made during the project. I guess my most important take away is to keep getting your work reviewed, listen to what others think of your work, and make design changes accordingly.

- For example, the general logic flow is one of the most important designs for projects, it determines whether audience can easily understand your story or your point. However, when I am doing the project, I am very familiar with the story context and background infomation, so I can easily miss some parts of the logical flow and assume that people can easily understand the logical transitions. However, sometimes, that's where it will confuse audience. By talking to others and asking for opinion about logical flow, I am able to see where the logical transition is not smooth, how could I add/edit content to make the storyline smooth.

- Also, talking to people about graphics can help you know what should you highlight, what could you delete. When talking to audience about visualization, I could easily see where they focus on, or curious about in the graph. It helps me to get rid of the parts that is unnecessary but distracting, helps me highlight the most important parts, and also helps me to add elements to help clarify contents that is potentially confusing. For example, the idea of highlighting mentioned neighborhoods on the map is great.

- Finally, talking to people about call to action can help you rethink what is the best way to achieve what you want to achieve, is there any actionable action that audience can easily do and make a change? For example, I heard from classmates that adding link to Pittsburgh local community social media can help audience easily know where to get related information and take action. That's something great, but I didn't think about that before.

Besides talking to people, I think another takeaway is that story is the important thing, and maybe it is the thing to think first before looking at the data. As someone whose experience is in data science, I am focusing a lot of effort on data itself, thinking that only good data gives good story. I think that's why I am pretty comfortable with most of the analytical project. However, during the classes, I have seen many great projects that is well-designed, engaging and meaningful that do not require a lot of data or data processing. So, I guess maybe before diving into data directly, I should think about the stroy first, even should think about the wireframe before looking into data. That probably could give me a good storyline and then fit the data into the storyline. Data should serve the story, getting story out of data makes story telling harder.
