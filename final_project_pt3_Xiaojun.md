### User Research Protocol

#### Changes to make

- **Add element between slide 4 and 5, to strengthen the argument.**

1. Add pie charts to show a general picture of the type of offense people get arrested for. Add that pie chart plots would complete the general logic line from slide 4 to 5. Like, that's the general trend of arrest counts, how about break down to different offenses people get arrested for? Then let's take a look into some specific offenses.
2. In slide 5, don't try to get through the slide 5 too quickly. Consider show somes bar charts of other type of offenses that shows similar changes to strength the point that the behavior shows some changes, don't really need to introduce all the bars one by one, but just show some other bars to make the point stronger.

- **Emphasis on and clearify the call for action**

3. Clearify the call-for action, e.g. Follow the website to keep updated on the social equality movement, and pitch in when you can! e.g. Advocate local comunity/government/organizations to improve the situation in those mentioned neighborhoods.

- **Things to keep in mind when redo the visualizations**

4. When redo the visualizations, pay attention to having a constant color schema.
5. When redo the visualizations, make sure the map points are bigger, and spend a little time explaining the map.
