## Part I: Final Project Overview

### Outline

The project is trying to visualize arrest data in the Pittsburgh area to see if the data shows pattern of police discrimination against the african america community. Also, the project will look at pattern of police arrests over time, pre and post BLM movement to see if the BLM movement causes significant change of police arrest behavior.

Project structure:
- The background and relevant discussion of police injustice against the black community. A brief introduction about the BLM movement and its timeline in Pittsburgh area.
- Introduction of the Pitts arrest dataset
- Statistical visuals to show if there are signs of discrimination against the black community, and do a comparison of the stats before and after BLM to see if the situation change after BLM. 
- Map out the places of the arrest, colored by race (Black or White) to observe if there are clustering of arrest of one race, and see if the clusterings show a change after BLM.
- Conclusion of findings & call for action(maybe).


### Initial Sketches
<Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.>
Possible v bar chart show the number of arrest of black people against white, adjust for their population; bar graph show the comparision between balck arrest and white arrest for **minor charges** to see if there is further evidence of discrimination; bar chart show the comparision of stats before and after BLM.


### Data

The data is public data released by City of Pittburgh. [Data Source](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data?utm_campaign=Pittsburgh%20News&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9BN2I6Nm8g8AY3cDuchW_Y_KtEeMW4ncJecwVtfAaoX9IuGepIIdTDmmqjTGCA4jwDWCvF)
The data is stored in csv format, and contains more than 40,000 arrest record from 2016 to 2021 (still updating). In the dataset, each row is an arrest record, and the record contains the following information that I could use: (arrested person's) Age, Race, Gender, ArrestTime, ArrestLocation, TypeOfOffenses. 

Currently, I have ideas about using the data in the following ways: 1) map out the arrests in a Pittsburgh map. 2) use line charts to show trends overtime 3) use bar charts to do comparsions between arrests of different races.

### Method and medium
  
I am planning to complete the project on the shorthand platform. The visualizations would be made primarily in Tableau, maybe in Flourish as well, and we will get the embed code for the visuals to place into the shorthand desk to make the persentation.
