Outline
<Proposal includes a high-level summary of the project (sentence or two); project structure that outlines major elements of the story.>

The project is trying to visualize arrest data in the Pittsburgh area to see if the data shows police discrimination against the african america community. Also, if possible, the project will look at a comparsion of police arrest of african america pre and post BLM movement to see if the movement caused a change in police behavior.

Project structure:
- The background of police injustice against the black community.

Sketches
<Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.>

Data
<Data source identified. A copy of the data, or a recreated version of the data is available via a publicly-accessible link (Github, Box, or other publicly-accessible link). A couple of paragraphs that document data sources and how data will be used.>

The data is public data released by City of Pittburgh. [Data Source](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data?utm_campaign=Pittsburgh%20News&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9BN2I6Nm8g8AY3cDuchW_Y_KtEeMW4ncJecwVtfAaoX9IuGepIIdTDmmqjTGCA4jwDWCvF)
The data is stored in csv format, and contains more than 40,000 arrest record from 2016 to 2021 (still updating). In the dataset, each row is an arrest record, and the record contains the following information that I could use: (arrested person's) Age, Race, Gender, ArrestTime, ArrestLocation, TypeOfOffenses. 

Currently, I have ideas about using the data in the following ways: 1) map out the arrests in a Pittsburgh map. 2) use line charts to show trends overtime 3) use bar charts to do comparsions between arrests of different races.

Method and medium
<A few paragraphs documenting how the project will be completed. Platform for the final project identified.>

The project is most likely going to be completed on the shorthand platform.
