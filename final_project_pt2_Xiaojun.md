## Final Project Part II

### Wireframe
To better do user research, I built out a draft of my story in Shorthand to serve as Wireframe. 

The visualizations in the shorthand desks are generated with python codes, so they will serve as sketches for my future presentation visuals, and should be able to convey the ideas that I want to show. Those current visualizations will eventually be replaced with a final and more well-structured version made through Tableau.

The page and layouts are not final as well, but the shorthand desk should be able to show the general story line and serve as a wireframe for user research.

I am planning to complete the project story and presentation mainly on the shorthand platform. 

I will first see if I need to do some pre-processing data cleaning. If needed, then I would use Python or excel to pre-clean the data files.

The visualizations would be made primarily in Tableau, maybe in Flourish as well, and we will get the embed code for the visuals after the visuals are done.

The presentation would be made on the shorthand platform. The embed code for the visuals would be placed in the shorthand desk to combine the visuals into the persentation.
