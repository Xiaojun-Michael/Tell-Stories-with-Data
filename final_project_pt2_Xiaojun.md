## Final Project Part II

### Wireframe: a shorthand desk
To better do user research, I built out a draft of my story in Shorthand to serve as Wireframe. 

The visualizations in the shorthand desks are generated with python codes, so they will serve as sketches for my future presentation visuals, and should be able to convey the ideas that I want to show. Those current visualizations will eventually be replaced with a final and more well-structured version made through Tableau.

The page and layouts are not final as well, but the shorthand desk should be able to show the general story line and serve as a wireframe for user research.

### User Research Protocol

#### Target Audience
The target audience of the presentation should be people who are interested in social problems, racial equality and BLM. This presentation would be perticularly interesting to people who are interested in using quantiative method results for improvement of social problems.

#### Approach to identify representative individuals to interview
As a student in Heinz college, many of my friends are interested in poblic policy and pushing for social problem changes. So I would just identify some of my friends who take an interest in the related topics for the interview.

#### Goals/Questions 

| Goals  | Questions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Evaluate the overall story line  | Do people correctly get what the presentation is showing after a quick walkthorugh? |
| Evaluate the call for action  | Do people understand what the presentation is asking the viewer to do? Do they feel motivated to take action?  |
| Evaluate the general logic flow of the presentation  | Is the general logic of the presentation easy to follow?  |
| Evaluate the visualization presented  | Is the visulations shown easy to understand?  |
| Priortize what to fix  | What problems are most severe?  |

#### Interview Sctipts

**Brief Introduction:**
Thanks for helping with my user research today. My goal today is to get feedback on a wireframe I designed for the Tell-story-With-Data class at CMU. I'm going to present you the wireframe I have, and ask you for your comments on the different components of the wireframe to see what makes senses and what's confusing. I'm trying to test the clearity of my wireframe and try to improve it, so there are no wrong answers for you! The whole process should take less than 10 mins of your time, thanks again! Now let's get started.

**Main Section**
Today I will present my wireframe about <After BLM, what happened and what's next>. Go through the wireframe quickly, approximately 2 mins, and then ask for questions:
